👩🏻‍💻 Hey, I’m @sogol-tech
🔭 I’m interested in JS/REACT and becoming a Full Stack Developer. Through these skills, I want to curate online art exhibitions.  
💬 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I will delve into Python soon after. 
👀 I’m looking to collaborate on any project where I can learn and help to create intuitive and reliable websites.
